MIX is a computer architecture and assembly language developed by Donald Knuth. "MIX" stands for "Mixed Integer eXperiment". It was designed as a hypothetical computer for teaching purposes and is used in Knuth's book "The Art of Computer Programming". MIX has a 4000-word memory, 5 index registers, and a variety of instructions for arithmetic, logical, and input/output operations. It is a 32-bit architecture with a fixed instruction format. The MIX assembly language is used to write programs for the MIX computer.
